Introduction to Python

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, we will cover the following:

 - Learn the syntax of Python 3
 - Learn basic programming concepts and data structures

 ## Setting Up

 - Download Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/ 
    - Please ensure that you have admin priviledges on your laptop to install and use anaconda successfully
 - Download the Jupyter notebook file in this repository
 - Run Jupyter notebook (from the start menu or from anaconda navigator) and 'upload' the jupyter notebook file, or navigate to the file location of the jupyter notebook file that you have downloaded.

 * If you have any issue with installing the above, try:
    * https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information has detailed installation instructions.
    * Try googling your issue directly
    * Have a look through the help at https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues.
    * Shoot us an email if you're still stuck.

 ## Activity 1: Why Programming? Why Python?
 
 * As a group we go through some personal introductions, and then discussions about coding and python.
 * Programming fosters creativity, reasoning, logic and problem solving. Learning to code can prompt you to think differently and attack problems from different angles. 
 * Python is used broadly in education, science, and industry.
 * Anaconda and jupyter notebook is a distribution of python that very easy to install.

 ## Activity 2: Basic Programming Concepts

 * As a group, we move through the contents inside of the Jupyter notebook file.
     * The Jupyter notebook contains explanations of each and code-a-long exercises. 
     * Jupyter notebook is handy because you can write and run code right inside of the Jupyter notebook file. 
     * While Jupyter notebook is really very intuitive and easy to use, if you get stuck, or wish to read some more detailed documentation and information about jupyter notebook, see https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html

 * Topics introduced are:
     * Values, Variables, and Types
     * Operators
     * Functions
     * Objects and Methods
         * Lists
     * Input and Output
     * Control Structures
        * If statements
        * Loops

 * Documentation/further reading:
     * Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
     * Python 3 tutorial on tutorials point (Good for quick reference): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/index.htm

 ## Wrap Up

 - In this workshop, we covered introductory coding concepts taught through hands-on code a long activities using Jupyter Notebook, guided by the lead instructor of the workshop.
 - Reflection questions to reinforce what they have learnt (refer to the curriculum template for more explanation)
